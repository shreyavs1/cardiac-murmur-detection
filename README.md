# Cardiac Murmur Detection – Deep Learning Project

This project uses deep learning to detect cardiac murmurs from heart sound recordings using the CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram Dataset.
All analysis, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training are done in the Kaggle notebook CARDIAC-MURMUR.ipynb.

🔍 What the Project Does

Loads and processes PCG (heart sound) audio files

Converts audio into mel spectrograms

Trains a deep-learning model (Keras) to classify Normal vs Murmur

Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
